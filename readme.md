This is the first project in The Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations. 

The purpose of this project is simply to set up a skeleton HTML file linked with an empty CSS style sheet and an empty JS file to serve as the starting template for future web projects. Live link: https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_foundations_1_git_test/. 

What I learned:

- Essential elements or tags required to create a basic HTML webpage.

- How to link a CSS style sheet and JS script file to a HTML file.

- Creating new repositories on Git and Github.

- Using the shell command line to clone, add, commit and push files onto Github.
