This is the first project in The Odin Project's Foundations program (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations). The purpose of this project is simply to set up a github account, create a new repository, and make changes to it using git on the local machine's cammand line.

What I learned:

- Creating new repositories on Git and Github.

- Using the shell command line on my local machine to clone, add, commit and push files onto Github.
